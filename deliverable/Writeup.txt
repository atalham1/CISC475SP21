Logic Gate Simulator
Write-up

Part I - What is working
    On the web-page:
        play button (play functionality limited; see code comments)
        stop button
        delete button
        move button
        wire button  (button works not wires fully see code comments and Part II)
        
        All gate buttons, positive input, zero input, led output buttons

        Click a button to select a gate to place. Click the grid to place it.
        Click the 'move' button to be able to drag a gate around.
        Click the 'delete' button, then click a gate to remove it.
        Click 'wire' button, then click on the grid and drag across to draw wire.
        Click 'play' button to simulate current 
            (requires only 1 LED output on grid. Output is printed to console(inspect element).
             Connect the LED to what you want to see the resulting output of. See code comments
             for more info.)
        Click 'stop' button to stop current/simulation

    Not on web page:
        Save 'nodes' set to JSON file.


Part II - What doesn't work / not implemented (See code comments for details)
    Save & Load - button and interface for web page
    Load function
    Wires:
        moving, deleting, carrying signal
    Button (circuit piece)
    Switch
    Two-Pole-Switch
    Alternating input
    Display digit
    Labels
    Auto Grading
    Possible connection with moodle
    Display output on webpage (currently displayed in console log)


Part III - Outline of Code structure & basics of how it works

    HTML:
		- Imports style.css for basic presentation of webpage
		- Loads all div classes (menu bar, canvas, etc.)
		- Loads all buttons with img src from images folder (if applicable)
		- Imports scripts (grid.js, node-gate.js, main.js)
    Images:
        Creation:
			- Each gate image is loaded via constructor in each gate class (node-gate.js)
				and drawn in main.js
			- The images, created in Photoshop, were made to scale to the grid
				- All nodes and edges align with grid
        Sizing:
			- Each "grid unit" = 1 box
				- 10px x 10px
			- Each gate image has an indicator for its size 
				- (i.e. "7x6_LED" is 7 grid units wide and 6 grid units tall
					or 70px x 60px)
    Javascript:
		- grid.js
			- Contains functions for drawing grid lines,
				as well as the grid itself
			- Gets canvas element in HTML by id ("grid")
		- node-gate.js
			- Main "back end" script containing the functionality of circuit pieces and nodes.
			- CircuitNode class holds the information of pieces as it relates to the parent/child connections.
			- CircuitPiece is the superclass of all circuit pieces
				- Holds all attributes of the circuits such as x,y location of the top left of the circuit piece, name,
				  and x,y locations of all inputs and output locations which are placed in an array of varying size based on the circuit piece.
				- Those locations are tracked and set via setLocation(x,y)
				- SetLocation of the inputs and outputs are set for the standard two inputs one output of the 10x6 images and overridden in other cases.
			- Sub classes are all of the circuit pieces and adds in the attribute of input and output to track flow within the full circuit,
			  also added is the src img of the pieces.
				
			
		- main.js
			- Main "bridge" from front end to back end
			- Creates Sets for all nodes and wires on the screen to a null set, to later be added to.
			- Sets all relevant initial variables to null and false, to later be changed if necessary.
			- Contains functions for tracking new and removed connections which track whether input/output locations of different circuit pieces connect on the canvas.
			- Contains functions for saving and loading (not fully functional yet, see code comments)
			- Contains functions for drawing new gates and wires
				- Each specific element is added to a specific Set() with set properties
			- Adds event listeners to all buttons within the HTML
			- Adds event listener to the "gates" canvas on mouse down
				- If "deleting" button selected, carry out deleting function
				- If "moving" button selected, carry out moving function
					- checkClick(x,y): checks if click is on gate or nothing
				- If a "gate" button is selected, carry out function for placing and drawing gates
				- If "wire" button selected, carry out function for placing and drawing wires
